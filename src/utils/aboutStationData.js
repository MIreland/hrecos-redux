    'The HRECOS Pumped Monitoring Station at Marist College is configured to automatically collect physical water samples for investigating issues related to toxic chemicals, microbiology, and other topics. Water is continuously pumped from the river bottom into a tank where a “sonde” measures water quality parameters every 15 minutes. A separate set of sensors outside the pump house records surface water quality parameters and water elevation—data which is shown on this dashboard (to the right)',

  piermont: [
    'The Piermont HRECOS monitoring station is on the eastern end of the pier, about a mile into the river from the western shore of the wide Tappan Zee section. The station is just north of the Sparkill Creek and the Piermont Marsh, a place of complex and dynamic ecological processes.',
    'Tides exchange water between the Hudson and the marsh. Here the water is brackish (slightly salty), but can range to fresh depending on the season and weather events.',
    'This HRECOS monitoring station is operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (Columbia University) researchers.',

    'Hudson River Park is a four-mile park and estuarine sanctuary running from Chambers St. to W59th. The Park’s 400 acres of sanctuary waters is home to 70 species of fish and the inspiration for the Park’s numerous environmental education and stewardship initiatives that engage over 27,000 participants annually.',
    'The HRECOS water quality monitoring station located at the western end of this pier is one of two in Hudson River Park, with the other located at Pier 26. To participate in one of our programs or to learn more about how we use HRECOS data in the park, please visit hudsonriverpark.org',

    'This station is owned and operated by the Sarah Lawrence College Center for the Urban River at Beczak (CURB) and is housed on the Groundwork Hudson Valley Science Barge. The barge is located in Yonkers just south of CURB and in close proximity to the mouth of the Saw Mill River and several Combined Sewer Overflow outfalls. The magnitude and frequency of the effects from these features on the data are not yet known.',
    'CURB educates 5,000 youth annually on the Hudson River and urban watershed issues and integrates HRECOS in their curriculum and teacher trainings. They also use the data for ongoing research and monitoring programs including fish and eel tracking and water quality studies. Education and research partners are welcome; please contact CURB for more info! www.slccurb.org',

    `The Hudson River Port of Albany monitoring station, 
    operated by New York State Department of Conservation (NYSDEC), 
    collects continuous water quality and weather data year-round. 
    This monitoring station is mounted on the western shoreline of the Hudson River at the Port of Albany, 
    just to the south of the Cargill Grainery. 
    Data collected at this station will be used to evaluate the impact of efforts to reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in this area.`,
